# 8-6.  City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name 
#       of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like this:
#       "Santiago, Chile"
#       Call your function with at least three city-country pairs, and print the 
#       values that are returned.

def city_country(city, country):
    print({country}, {city})

print('–£–ª–∞–∞–Ω–±–∞–∞—Ç–∞—Ä', "–ú–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª")
print('–ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞', "–û—Ä–æ—Å")
print('–ê—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞', "–ö–∞–∑–∞–∫—Å—Ç–∞–Ω")

# 8-7.  Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary 
#       describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an 
#       album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of 
#       information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different 
#       albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the 
#       album information correctly.
#       Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to 
#       store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line includes a value for 
#       the number of songs, add that value to the album‚Äôs dictionary. Make at least 
#       one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.

# 8-8.  User Albums: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a while
#       loop that allows users to enter an album‚Äôs artist and title. Once you have that 
#       information, call make_album() with the user‚Äôs input and print the dictionary 
#       that‚Äôs created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop
