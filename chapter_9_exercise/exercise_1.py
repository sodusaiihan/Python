# 9-1.  Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for 
#       Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. 
#       Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of 
#       information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.
#       Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes individually, 
#       and then call both methods.

# 9-3.  Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
#       and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored 
#       in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary 
#       of the user‚Äôs information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints 
#       a personalized greeting to the user.
#       Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods 
#       for each user.
